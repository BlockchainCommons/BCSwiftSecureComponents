## Introduction

The Secure Components suite provides tools for easily implementing encryption (symmetric or public key), signing, and sharding of messages, and representation of knowledge graphs, including serialization to and from [CBOR](https://cbor.io/), and [UR](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2020-005-ur.md) formats.

## Status

**DRAFT.** There is a reference implementation of parts of this document in [BCSwiftFoundation](https://github.com/blockchaincommons/BCSwiftFoundation), but everything is still fluid and subject to change.

**⚠️ WARNING:** As of the date of this publication the CBOR tags in the range `48` through `51` and `55` are currently unallocated in the [IANA Registry of CBOR Tags](https://www.iana.org/assignments/cbor-tags/cbor-tags.xhtml). Blockchain Commons is applying for these numbers to be assigned to the CBOR specification herein, but because these numbers are in a range that is open to other applications, it may change. For now, these low-numbered tags MUST be understood as provisional and subject to change by all implementors.

## Goals

The goal is to create a general purpose, composable suite of data types that:

* Are based on object-centric architecture
* Make it easy to represent common encryption constructions
* Are based on algorithms and constructs that are considered best practices.
* Allow for the future extension of functionality to include additional cryptographic algorithms and methods.
* Represent structured data using [CBOR](https://cbor.io/) and [UR](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2020-005-ur.md).
* Support innovative constructs like [Sharded Secret Key Reconstruction (SSKR)](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2020-011-sskr.md).
* Interoperate with structures of particular interest to blockchain and cryptocurrency developers, such as [seeds](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2020-006-urtypes.md#cryptographic-seed-crypto-seed) and [HD keys](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2020-007-hdkey.md).
* Support protocols like [Distributed Identifiers](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/).
* Support complex metadata (assertions about assertions).
* Support semantic knowledge graphs.
* Support mutable and immutable architectures.
* Provide a reference API implementation in Swift that is easy to use and hard to abuse.

Other goals we are considering include:

* Support eventual consistency using [conflict-free replicated datatypes (CRDTs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type).
* Minimize opportunities for correlation without first demonstrating ability to decrypt or provide an adapter signature.
* Correlation resistance leveraging similarities between UUIDs, nonces, hashes, content addressable hashes, signatures, etc.
* Focus first on peer-based, web-of-trust, self-sovereign key models for roots of trust, where peers may be groups.
* Support “Progressive Trust” models:
    * Progressive trust is the ability of an individual to gradually increase the amount of relevant data revealed as trust is built or value generated.
    * [W3C Data Minimization](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/data-minimization/#progressive-trust)
    * [Original concept](http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2004/08/progressive_tru.html)
* Default and fundamental support of aggregated group multisig signatures, in particular prime-order curves like secp256k1, or point-compressed cofactor solutions like [ristretto255](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-irtf-cfrg-ristretto255-00.html):
    * Reason? Multisig attacks:

        * [Attack on Monero using 25519](https://jonasnick.github.io/blog/2017/05/23/exploiting-low-order-generators-in-one-time-ring-signatures/)
* Fundamental support for redactable signatures, possibly:
    * Bauer, Blough, Cash - [Minimal Information Disclosure with Efficiently Verifiable Credentials](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.153.8662&rep=rep1&type=pdf)
* Support for various modern techniques like signature aggregation (Musig2 m of m), threshold signatures (FROST n of m), adapter signatures, scriptless scripts, discrete log contracts, Brandian blind signatures (and improvements), smart signature scripts, distributed key generation & verifiable secret sharing

## Top-Level Types

The types defined in the Secure Components suite are designed to be minimal, easy to use, and composable. They can all be used independently, but are designed to work together. Here is a quick summary of these types:

* `Envelope` is the central "top level" type of Secure Components. Envelopes support everything from enclosing the most basic of plaintext messages, to innumerable recursive permutations of encryption, signing, sharding, and the representation of semantic graphs.
* `EncryptedMessage` is a symmetrically-encrypted message and is specified in full in [BCR-2022-001](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2022-001-secure-message.md).
* `PrivateKeyBase` holds key material such as a Seed belonging to an identifiable entity, and can produce all the private and public keys needed to use this suite. It is usually only serialized for purposes of backup.
* `PublicKeyBase` holds the public keys of an identifiable entity, and can be made public. It is not simply called a "public key" because it holds at least _two_ public keys: one for signing and another for encryption.
* `SealedMessage` is a message that has been one-way encrypted to a specific `PublicKeyBase`, and is used to implement multi-recipient public key encryption using `Envelope`.
* `Digest` is a cryptographic hash that uniquely identifies an immutable binary object.
* `SCID` is a "self-certifying identifier" that uniquely identifies a mutable set of traits.

Many of the types defined herein are assigned CBOR tags for use when encoding these structures. The types in this section may be used embedded within larger structures as tagged CBOR, or as top-level objects in URs. Note that when encoding URs, a top-level CBOR tag is not used, as the UR type provides that information.

|CBOR Tag|UR Type|Swift Type|
|---|---|---|
|48|`crypto-msg`|`EncryptedMessage`|
|49|`envelope`|`Envelope`|
|50|`crypto-prvkeys`|`PrivateKeyBase`|
|51|`crypto-pubkeys`|`PublicKeyBase`|
|55|`crypto-sealed`|`SealedMessage`|
|56|`crypto-digest`|`Digest`|
|57|`crypto-key`|`SymmetricKey`|
|58|`crypto-scid`|`SCID`|

## Tagged Types

Types that do not define a UR type generally would never be serialized as a top-level object, but are frequently serialized as part of a larger structure. Some of the types below have a single-byte CBOR tag due to their frequency of use in the `Envelope` type.

|CBOR Tag|Swift Type|
|---|---|
|59|`Predicate`|
|60|`Plaintext`|
|61|`Signature`|
|62|`AgreementPublicKey`|
|700|`Password`|
|701|`Permit`|
|702|`AgreementPrivateKey`|
|704|`SigningPrivateKey`|
|705|`SigningPublicKey`|
|707|`Nonce`|

## Untagged Types

A number of types are simply serialized as untagged CBOR byte strings. They do not need tags because they are used in particular contexts where their meaning is fixed and unlikely to change over time. These include:

* `AAD`
* `Auth`
* `Ciphertext`
* `Plaintext`
* `Salt`
* `Tag`

For example, a field called `Auth` is currently only used in the context of the IETF-ChaCha20-Poly1305 encryption algorithm, and therefore does not need to be specifically tagged. If another algorithm also needed a field called `Auth`, it would be used in the context of *that* algorithm, and the two fields would not be considered interchangeable.
